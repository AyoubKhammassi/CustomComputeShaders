# CustomComputeShader

A minimal Unreal Engine 4 porject for adding and using a compute shader. I published an article that covers the main steps of the process and I use this project as an example. 

## Modules:
* **CustomComputeShader** : The primary game module
* **CustomShadersDeclarations** : The game module that contains all the code for adding and using the compute shader

##  Shaders:
* **WhiteNoiseCS** : A simple compute shader that renders white noise to a texture
